[remove "you three", don't tell them what they know]

(CHOICE 1) Mrs. Crawford

Protagonist: Yes you Mrs. Crawford...when conversing with the help, I found that you and your late husband no longer shared a room
Protagonist: in fact you decided to move into a bedroom on the other side of the mansion a few years ago.
Protagonist: Was there trouble in paradise? 
Samuel: (snickers)
Protagonist: Samuel! Do you have something to say on this matter?
Samuel: You didn't hear it from me, but the man was fruitier than the banana daiquiri's he has had me make for him and his gentleman friends. 
Samuel: Several years ago Mr. Crawford decided that he preferred the company of other men than the women he choose to be his wife.
Mrs. Crawford: YOU SWORE YOU WOULD NEVER TELL!!!
Samuel: That promise was to Mr.Crawford...not to you.
Mrs. Crawford: Its true...but I loved my husband and he loved me
Samuel: He loved everyone in his own way.
Mrs.Crawford: its true that if his secret were to be exposed it would be the social death of me, but that isn't enough reason to kill my husband
Protagonist: I will be the judge of that
Protagonist: now I will hear from (RETURN TO CHOICE)

[rephrase daquiri sentence, "you didn't hear it from me"?, ]

(Choice 2) Samuel

Protagonist: You Samuel...the faithful butler spending many long hours by Mr.Crawford's side
Samuel: Knowing that man made me a better person
Alistair: more like a better foot rest
Protagonist: what?
Alistair: Everyone knew that my father enjoyed embarrassing Samuel in every way he could.
AListari: most nights after Samuel made daddy's tea he would ask Samuel to get down on his hands and knees and use him as a foot rest.
Samuel: The demands of the jobs are ever changing.
AListair: I've talked to the help. you bad mouthed my father at every chance you could and would jest about poisoning his tea
Samuel: that was merely dark humour shared among friends. It was not a plan and as you can see if I was planning on poising him it clearly did not work.
Protagonist: I can see how you would have reason to kill him...but I'm not sure I'm convinced
Protagonist: I should hear from (RETURN TO CHOICE)


(CHOICE 3) Alistair


Protagonist: Alistair...the one and only son what motive could you possibly have for killing your father
Mrs. Crawford: Money. the snivelling little shit was always after my husband for money
AListair: Now that is not true...I loved father
Mrs. Crawford: only when he bought things for you and I know you've read his will...boy never did have much respect for privacy
Mrs. Crawford: you knew that he left you a sizeable amount of money and I know you know.
Alistair: Mother?! what are you accusing me of?
Mrs. Crawford: give up the act.... no one's buying it
AListair: Well what if I did know that most of the family fortune would go to me in case of his death.
Alistair: He would buy me most anything I needed anyway...why would I kill him to get what I can already get.
Mrs. Crawford: Because you knew that he intended to change his will...
Mrs. Crawford: in old age my husband had become charitable and you knew that he had planned to donate his fortune to the less fortunate
Protagonist: interesting....interesting....I think I need to hear more from (RETURN TO CHOICE)


(once all three have been heard from)
Protagonist: I think I've heard enough....the killer is (CHOICE)
(CHOICE) 1. Mrs. Crawford   2. Samuel   3. AListari

(CHOICE 1) Mrs. Crawford

Protagonist: The murderer is you Mrs. Crawford
Mrs. Crawford: Its true... I couldn't live with the shame of being married to a confirmed bachelor
Mrs. Crawford: If my friends found out... I would be ruined.
Mrs. Crawford: I thought that if I got him out of the way I could go back to having a normal life
Mrs. Crawford: I had planned to poison his tea and blame Samuel but the man would not die.
Mrs. Crawford: I became desperate and couldn't take it any more...so I killed my husband

(CHOICE 2) Samuel


Protagonist: The murderer is you Samuel
Samuel: Well the old bastard deserved it.
Samuel: using me as a footrest...How dare he.
Samuel: I knew the man's boy had a mean streak so I figured I could stab him to death and blame the son
Samuel: Clearly I was wrong, but if I could still blame the boy I would like to.
Samuel: Oh well... maybe I can serve tea in prison.

(CHOICE 3) AListair

Protagonist: The murderer is you Alistair
Alistair: how dare you accuse me of that!
Protagonist: because you killed him
Alistair: You can't prove that I came in here and stabbed daddy.
AListair: no one was around, and I knew that I could blame mother
Alistair: oh...can I take that back
Mrs. Crawford: never was a clever boy
Alistair: well you got me. I killed him, but the money was mine.
AListair: I deserved it, not some starving street urchin, what have the poor every done for Father?
Alistair: Giving his money to those that don't deserve it is the real crime. Arrest him for that
Protagonist: instead I'll have to settle for arresting you for the actual crime of murder
